BackgroundTab for NewsBlur
==========================

Now licensed under GPL Version 3 and available in the Chrome Web Store:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/background-tab-for-newsbl/ieeimmkgocgaaabphkgjdkophaejfnlk/


New in 0.3.0: Added customizable hotkey support.



This Chrome extension allows you to open the currently selected story in NewsBlur in a background tab by pressing a defined hotkey (default ";").

Note: This extension was previously obsolete, with Newsblur implementing a function to open links in the background.

However, Chrome 41 broke Newsblur's implemnentation.  This version was released to the Stable channel in March 2015.

See https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/655 for details on this issue.


To Install:
1) Download files and put into a directory
2) Go to chrome://extensions
3) Enable Developer mode
4) Select "Load Unpacked Extension..."
5) Select the directory.

It should then be installed.

TODO:
- ~~Get feedback about international versions~~
- ~~Add customizable hotkey~~
- Determine if regular "o" hotkey can be overridden.
- ~~Distribute the crx file.~~
