NewsBlurBackgroundTab
=====================

Note: This extension appears to be obselete.  Newsblur now opens links in background.

However, it appears that Chrome 41 may break Newsblur's implemnentation.  This is expected to be released to the Stable channel in early March.  If this is the case, I will update this extension to restore this functionality.

See https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/655 for details.
