BackgroundTab for NewsBlur
==========================

Now licensed under GPL Version 3 and available in the Chrome Web Store:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/background-tab-for-newsbl/ieeimmkgocgaaabphkgjdkophaejfnlk/


Note: This extension was previously obselete, with Newsblur implementing a function to open links in the background.

However, it appears that Chrome 41 breaks Newsblur's implemnentation.  This version is expected to be released to the Stable channel in March 2015.  I plan to update this extension, though it appears to still work on Chrome 41 Beta.

See https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/655 for details on this issue.





This Chrome extension allows you to open the currently selected story in NewsBlur in a background tab by pressing ";".

To Install:
1) Download files and put into a directory
2) Go to chrome://extensions
3) Enable Developer mode
4) Select "Load Unpacked Extension..."
5) Select the directory.

It should then be installed.

TODO:
- Get feedback about international versions
- Add customizable hotkey
- Determine if regular "o" hotkey can be overridden.
- Distribute the crx file.
